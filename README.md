# watch-time

Simple app that shows you the current time in digital form and analog form. There's available a macOS app and Linux app, and can show you in digital format or analog format (in Linux) or both (in macOS). Aesthetics are the same, despite the fact that they're using different UI frameworks.

## How to compile?

On macOS, you need Xcode. On Linux, you need either `gcc` or `clang` and `GTK+ 3` with version 3.8 or higher.

To compile, execute `make.sh` script in the terminal and you will see `time` executable appear.
